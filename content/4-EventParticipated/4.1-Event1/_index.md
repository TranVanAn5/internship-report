# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 Workshop” 

### Event Objectives

- An overview of the AWS AI/ML Services ecosystem, especially Amazon SageMaker.

- Providing knowledge about the end-to-end Machine Learning process from data preparation to model deployment.

- In-depth presentation on Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock and prominent Foundation Models such as Claude, Llama and Titan.

- Technical guidance on Prompt Engineering, RAG architecture and Bedrock Agents for multi-step workflows.

### Speakers

- **AWS AI/ML Specialist Team** – AWS Vietnam
- **AWS Solutions Architect**
- **AI/ML Community Leader in Vietnam**

### Key Highlights

#### AWS AI/ML Services Overview – Amazon SageMaker

- **Amazon SageMaker** is introduced as a comprehensive ML platform, fully supporting the lifecycle of Machine Learning.

- **Data preparation & labeling:** Introducing SageMaker Data Wrangler, Ground Truth, to help standardize and label data effectively.

- **Model training, tuning, deployment:** Workflow for model training, optimization (hyperparameter tuning) and deployment on endpoints.

- **Integrated MLOPS:** SageMaker Pipelines & Model Registry to help automate CI/CD for ML models.

#### Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

**Foundation Models Overview**
- Compare Claude, Llama, and Titan based on context length, reasoning quality, inference speed, fine-tuning, and suitability for each use case.

**Prompt Engineering Techniques**
- Apply Chain-of-Thought, few-shot prompting, and clear prompt structure to increase accuracy.

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- Explain the RAG architecture and how to integrate a Knowledge Base in Amazon Bedrock to optimize answers based on business data.

**Bedrock Agents**
- Introduce the ability to create agents to execute multi-step workflows and integrate with external systems.

### Key Takeaways

#### Knowledge About Traditional AI/ML (Machine Learning)

- Understand the standard process of an ML project: data collection, processing, training, optimization, deployment, MLOps.

- Know how to use Amazon SageMaker as a standardized ML platform, suitable for businesses.

#### Knowledge About Generative AI

- Ability to analyze and choose a Foundation Model suitable for the problem.

- Effective prompt writing skills using advanced techniques (CoT, few-shot).

- Master the RAG architecture — an important foundation in building enterprise chatbots.

- Understand the operating mechanism of Bedrock Agents and how to automate workflows.

#### Deployment Skills

- Understand how to combine Bedrock + SageMaker in an integrated ML system.

- Understand how to build a real GenAI chatbot with guardrails to ensure safety.

### Applying to Work

- **Building a GenAI chatbot:** Can apply Bedrock Agents and RAG knowledge to internal chatbot projects.

- **Optimizing Prompt Engineering:** Using CoT, few-shot into the current workflow to increase accuracy.

- **Upgrading AI architecture:** Better understanding how to combine MLOps and GenAI into real products.
