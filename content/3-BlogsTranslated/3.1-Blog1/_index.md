# AWS Lambda introduces tiered pricing for Amazon CloudWatch logs and additional logging targets

*by Shridhar Pandey and Matthew Barker | May 1, 2025 | [[Announcements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/category/post-types/announcements/)], [[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/category/compute/aws-lambda/)], [[Intermediate (200)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/category/learning-levels/intermediate-200/)], [[Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/category/serverless/)]*

Effective logging is an important part of an observability strategy when building serverless applications with **AWS Lambda**.

Lambda automatically collects and sends logs to **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**. This allows you to focus on building application logic rather than setting up logging infrastructure, and makes it easier for operators to troubleshoot errors and performance.

On May 1, 2025, AWS announced changes to Lambda logging that reduce the cost of Lambda CloudWatch logging and make it easier and more cost-effective to use multiple monitoring tools. Lambda Logs is now available with tiered pricing based on volume when using the CloudWatch Logs Standard and Infrequent Access log classes. When you create Lambda logs at scale, you can expect to see immediate cost reductions under this new pricing model. In addition to CloudWatch Logs, Lambda now also supports **Amazon S3** and **Amazon Data Firehose** as additional destinations for Lambda logs. Lambda logs are sent to S3, and Firehose is also available with tiered pricing based on volume.

This blog post covers some recent Lambda logging improvements and describes how these changes provide a simpler, more cost-effective logging experience for Lambda.

## Overview

Logging provides developers and operators with valuable data to debug and troubleshoot application behavior, performance issues, and potential errors. This becomes even more important for serverless applications built with Lambda due to the transient and stateless nature of the **Lambda execution environment**. Lambda's built-in integration with CloudWatch Logs ensures that logs for every function call are available for analysis. The log data collected includes application logs generated by your Lambda function code and system logs generated by the Lambda service when running the function code. CloudWatch Logs allows you to search, filter, and analyze log data for troubleshooting, monitoring metrics, and setting up alerts.

Logging requirements are growing as serverless applications become more complex and scale, sometimes consisting of hundreds or thousands of Lambda functions, generating significant log volumes. Organizations need sophisticated logging solutions that can handle this scale while remaining cost-effective. Some scenarios, such as monitoring critical business transactions, require real-time log analysis, while others focus on post-event forensic analysis. Debug logs from development and staging environments typically require high granularity, while you may want lower granularity in production logs to improve signal-to-noise ratio.

### Recent Improvements to Lambda Logging

In recent years, Lambda and CloudWatch Logs have expanded Lambda's logging capabilities to meet the growing needs of serverless applications. These capabilities provide deeper insights, better control, and more cost-effective solutions for collecting, processing, and consuming logs, thereby enhancing the serverless observability experience. **Lambda advanced logging controls** give developers control over log creation and content. These controls allow you to collect Lambda logs in a structured JSON format. You don't need to use a logging library and customize separate log levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR) for application logs and system logs. This reduces logging costs by ensuring only the logs needed are generated while maintaining appropriate visibility across different environments. For example, you can set a granular DEBUG logging level in development environments while limiting production logging to ERROR to improve signal-to-noise ratio and control costs.

The **Infrequent Access log class** for CloudWatch Logs introduces a cost-effective solution for logs that need to be retained but are rarely accessed. The Infrequent Access class has a 50% lower ingestion price per GB than the Standard log class. This tailored feature set allows you to reduce logging costs while maintaining access to historical data for compliance, audit, or forensic analysis purposes.

**CloudWatch Logs Live Tail** is a real-time, interactive log analysis and streaming feature. Live Tail simplifies debugging and monitoring; it allows you to observe log output as your functions execute without leaving the Lambda console. This makes it easier to identify and diagnose issues during development and troubleshooting. Live Tail Logs is also available in the **Visual Code IDE**.

## Tiered Pricing for Lambda Logs in CloudWatch Logs

Starting today, Lambda logs sent to CloudWatch Logs will be classified as Vended Logs, which are logs from specific AWS services available at volume pricing. This replaces the previous flat pricing model when using the CloudWatch Logs Standard log class. For example, in the AWS US East (N. Virginia) Region, you were charged $0.50 per GB for using the Standard log class for your Lambda logs. Under the new pricing model, you are charged for sending Lambda logs to CloudWatch Logs starting at $0.50 per GB for the first use. As log volume increases, the price per GB automatically decreases across tiers, down to as low as $0.05 per GB at the lowest tier. This price change is automatically applied to all Lambda logs sent to CloudWatch Logs, requiring no code or configuration changes.

| Ingested Data | CloudWatch Standard Logs | CloudWatch Logs Infrequent Access |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **First 10 TB/month** | $0.50/GB | $0.25/GB |
| **Next 20 TB/month** | $0.25/GB | $0.15/GB |
| **Next 20 TB/month** | $0.10/GB | $0.075/GB |
| **More than 50 TB/month** | $0.05/GB | $0.05/GB |

When you create Lambda logs at scale, you will see immediate cost reductions under this new pricing model. For example, if you create 60 TB of Lambda logs per month in CloudWatch Logs, your cost will decrease by 58% (from $30,000 to $12,500). The pricing tiers scale with your logging volume, ensuring cost benefits increase as your application grows. This allows you to maintain comprehensive logging practices that could have been prohibitively expensive in the past. Tiered pricing for Vended logs applies to all Vended logs ingested into CloudWatch, not per-service tiers.

When collecting other off-the-shelf logs, such as **Amazon Virtual Private Cloud flow logs** and **Amazon Route 53 resolver query logs**, you will see a larger discount when tiering is applied to the consolidated log collection volume.

## New Lambda Logging Destinations: Amazon S3 and Amazon Data Firehose

Starting today, in addition to CloudWatch Logs, Lambda also supports Amazon S3 and Amazon Data Firehose as destinations for Lambda logs. When using S3 or Firehose as a destination, logging costs start at $0.25/GB. Tiered pricing also applies, with prices dropping to $0.05/GB at the lowest tier. This tiered pricing also applies to consolidated log volumes.

| Ingested Data | CloudWatch Standard Logs | CloudWatch Logs Infrequent Accesses |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **First 10 TB/month** | $0.50/GB | $0.25/GB |
| **Next 20 TB/month** | $0.25/GB | $0.15/GB |
| **Next 20 TB/month** | $0.10/GB | $0.075/GB |
| **More than 50 TB/month** | $0.05/GB | $0.05/GB |

*Table 2: Tiered Pricing for Lambda Log Delivery to Amazon S3 and Amazon Data Firehose in the US East (N. Virginia) Region *

Delivering Lambda logs directly to S3 provides more flexibility in log management. Firehose support simplifies the delivery of Lambda logs to additional destinations such as **Amazon OpenSearch Service**, HTTP endpoints, and **third-party observability providers**. This fits with the established log delivery model used with other AWS compute services such as **Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)** and **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)**.

This new capability provides significant cost benefits and streamlines the delivery of logs to additional logging destinations, making it easier to use multiple monitoring tools (including CloudWatch) when building serverless applications with Lambda.

### Setting up a new Lambda logging destination

[cite_start]All new and existing Lambda functions have CloudWatch Logs as the default logging destination, with S3 and Firehose as alternatives[cite: 1]. [cite_start]When you choose S3 or Firehose, Lambda will send logs via a new CloudWatch Logs delivery log class**[cite: 1].

Basic setup steps in the Lambda console:

All new and existing Lambda functions have CloudWatch Logs as the logging destinationdefault logs, with S3 and Firehose as alternatives. When you select S3 or Firehose as the log destination, Lambda sends logs to the selected destination via a new CloudWatch Logs delivery log class. This log class enables efficient routing but does not support CloudWatch Logs Standard log class features, such as Logs Insights and Live Tail.

To set up S3 or Firehose as the destination for your Lambda logs in the Lambda console:

1. Navigate to the Lambda console, and select or create a function to set up an S3 or Firehose log destination.

2. In the Configuration tab, select Monitoring and operations tools in the left pane.

3. Select Edit under Logging configuration. This opens the Edit logging configuration page

4. In the "Log destination" section, select Amazon S3 or Amazon Data Firehose. Amazon CloudWatch Logs is the default selection.

5. In CloudWatch delivery log group, select Create new log group or Existing log group.

6. To create a new delivery log group to send logs to S3, enter a log group name and specify the destination S3 bucket. Provide an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for CloudWatch Logs to deliver logs to S3.

7. To use an existing delivery log group, select one from the Delivery log group pool. The selected delivery log group must have a configured destination (S3 or Firehose) and match the destination you selected.

Advanced logging controls are also available for S3 and Firehose destinations. These controls include JSON structured format selection and log-level filters for both application and system logs. This gives you advanced log management controls for easier searching, filtering, and analysis. You can also use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like AWS CloudFormation and AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to set up Lambda log delivery to S3 and Firehose.

## Best Practices

To get the most out of the changes announced today, ensure your logging strategy closely aligns with your workload requirements. For example, consider sending critical production logs to CloudWatch Logs to take advantage of advanced real-time alerting and analytics features. You now automatically get volume discounts through tiered pricing in CloudWatch Logs for high-volume logging scenarios. For logs that require long-term retention for historical analysis, you can use S3 storage classes to further reduce costs. When using existing or third-party monitoring tools, direct integration through Firehose eliminates the need for custom forwarding solutions and associated costs.

Optimizing logging costs goes beyond destination selection. Regularly monitor log volumes to understand the impact of pricing tiers. Implement appropriate retention policies to prevent unnecessary archiving of old logs and log sampling for high-volume debug logs. Consider using different logging strategies across development, staging, and production environments to balance the need for visibility with cost-effectiveness.

## Conclusion

Tiered pricing for Lambda logs in CloudWatch Logs and S3 and Firehose support for additional logging destinations improve Lambda application observability. You can now manage logging costs at scale and extend your Lambda monitoring solutions through cost-effective, easy-to-configure integrations. Whether you are building new serverless applications or optimizing existing ones, these enhancements help you deploy comprehensive logging strategies that scale cost-effectively across your workloads.

New features announced today are available in all AWS Regions Support for configuring log delivery to S3 and Firehose in the Lambda console is currently available in the US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland) Regions, with additional Regions coming soon.
